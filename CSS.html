      <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used for describing the presentation of web pages, including their layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. It works alongside HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to define how HTML elements are displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

Key Concepts in CSS:
Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements that you want to style. Selectors can target elements based on their tag name (div, p, h1), class (.class-name), ID (#id-name), attributes ([type='text']), or even their relationship to other elements (div > p).

Properties: CSS properties define the visual appearance of the selected elements. Properties can control aspects like color (color, background-color), size (width, height), spacing (margin, padding), typography (font-family, font-size, line-height), and many others.

Values: Each property in CSS has a value associated with it, which determines how that property is applied. For example, color: red; sets the text color to red, while font-size: 16px; sets the font size to 16 pixels.

Selectors and Declarations: CSS rules consist of selectors and declarations. A selector points to the HTML element(s) you want to style, and declarations are the set of properties and their values that you want to apply to those elements.
